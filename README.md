## Overview
**Strawberry Hunt** is a 2D rendition of the classic snake game, built using C++ and the `raylib` game development library. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat strawberries, increasing your score as the game becomes progressively faster and more challenging.

## Features

- **Strawberry Item**: The strawberry serves as the main asset and food for the snake.
- **Score Tracking**: Each strawberry eaten increases the player's score.

- **Increasing Difficulty**: As the snake eats strawberries, it becomes longer and moves faster, intensifying the game.
